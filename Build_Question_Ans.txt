============================
SERVLET RELATED QUESTIONS:-
============================

Q.	How many types of session tracking.??????????? But how?????????
	Cookie 
	HiddenForm
	URL Rewriting

Q. 	How many way to destroy session?
 	There are three way of destroy session 
	1.session.invalidate();
	2.<session-config>
		<session-timeout>20<session-timeout>
	   </session-config>
	3.session.setMaxInactiveInterval();

Q.	How many types of create servlet.?
 	There are three type to create servlet 
	1.Servlet Interface
	2.GenericServlet Class 
	3.HttpServlet Class

Q.	What is servlet lifecycle.?
 	init()
	service()
	destroy()

Q.	Defference between generic servelt and http servlet.?
 	GenericServlet  defines a generic and protocol (set of rules) independent servlet. it implements Servlet interface that 
        has lifecycle methods of a servlet.
	HttpServlet defines an HTTP protocol specific servlet. it inherits the GenericServlet class. 
	HttpServlet provides service methods such as doGet() and doPost() for handling HTTP specific services.

Q.	Differentiate between GET and POST?

	Form submitted is encoded in URL but not in doPost.
	Since data is sent through URL therefore its request size(Parameter size less than 2KB) is restricted But there is no restriction in doPost().
	It is unsecure because its Parameter remains in browser history but doPost is secure.
	Contains only character but in doPost it also contains binary data.
	can be cached and can be bookmarked but in doPost it cannot be cached and bookmarked. 

Q.	doGet & doPost??? submit and view logic

Q.	When run for service method.?
	every request of user

Q.	Input & Bussiness validation are set in which scope? && Why not in session scope?
	REQUEST

Q.	Show methods of servlet which you have Extended? 
	HTTPSERVLET 		:- It inherit GenericServlet class, It is a base class of all servlets that handles HTTP requests.
	ITS METHODS ARE		:- doGet(), doPost(), doPut(), doHead(), doDelete() 
				   (ALSO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ITS doGet &doPost methods)

Q.	Difference between forword and send redirect.?
	Method forward() of request dispatcher object is used to forward request from one servlet to another servlet.
	Method sendRedirect of request dispatcher object is used to generate new request always and sent to another servlet.

Q.     how to enable session?
	HttpSession session = request.getSession(true);
	two method of Session 
	session.setAttributes();
	session.getAttributes();

Q.     difference between session(true) and session(false);	
	
	HttpSession session = request.getSession();
	if any session is existed in application it will get it; otherwise it will create new session.	
	HttpSession session = request.getSession(true);
	it always create new session.

Q.     how to set timeout for session in web.xml?
	<session-config>
		<session-timeout>20<session-timeout>
	</session-config>

Q.     what is the default timeout for session?
	web.xml 20 minutes(Server.xml)

Q.     difference between session and cookies?
 	session stored on server side and cookies stored in browser.

Q.     how to identify user on server?
 	By using session Tracking.

Q.	Who called service()?
	Container.

Q.	Who is calling validate()? 
	SERVICE() & IT IS CALLED BY CONTAINER & CONTAINER IS CALLED BY JVM.

Q.	 How you can check  that user logged in or not?? && And when does user State will show null??
	 On Header we are checking through session the statuss of user is null or not. OR we ccan also check it by session ID.

Q.	 Why did not we use request scope for logging instead of session?
	 Because if we do so then on every request of user we hve to authenticate user login id and password.

Q.	 Why devlopers are not recommended to override service method give reason?
	 Bcz it change the original defination of service().
	(Eg.To perform generic operation provided by devloper.Bcz it call goGet() by default.)

Q.	 How a client can communicatee to  server?
	 Using protocols. we used Http.

	jspDestroy()(JspPage interface)



========================
OOP RELATED QUESTIONS:-
========================
Q.	How can you achieve data abstration ?
   	Data Abstraction is process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality.
		2. Data Abstration in java is achieved by using interface and abstract class.

Q.	How can you achieve full abstration in your application ?
 	by using interface.

Q.	 What is Abstract Class ?
	 Abstract class is used when parent need to provide default default behavior along with abstract method.
         It enforces child classes to impletment specialized behavior of abstract methods. It can never be instantiated.

Q.	Why override service method?
	 We create custom ctl (BaseCtl) in which we write service method to provide generic operation flow. 
         we are not recommended to override the service method.

Q.	Difference between static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism.?
	static is done by overloadding . Eg. search(),list()   and dynamic is done method overriding.getKey(),
        getValue() of BaseBean.java.

Q.	 What is base bean .?
 	BaseBean is a parent class of all bean and it contains generic attributes.

Q.	What is basectl. And all methods.?
 	BaseCtl is parent ctl of all ctl and it contain generic work flow, generic operation,generic constants.
	Generic Work flow provides by services method.
	Generic Operation provides by basectl method. such as preload,validate,populateBean,getView().
	Generic Constants provides by all buttons.

Q.	How many types interface use for project.?
	DropDownListBean.java
	ORSView.java
	///AppRole.java


Q.	How many abstract class use for project.?
	
	BaseBean (implement DropDownlistBean,Serializable,Comparable )
	BaseCtl(extends HttpServlet class)


Q.	How to call  preload and validate in service method.
 	by ovrriding it.

	(preload- on every user request
	validate- when operation is not null, delete, cancel, view , reset.)

Q.     why BaseBean is abstract class in your project?
 	Because we do not define two method of DropDownListBean Interface getKey() and getValue().

Q.     what is service method? is it compulsary to ovveride it?
 	service is called at every user request and it is not advisable to override the service method.

Q.     how u r performing encapsulation in your project?
	   encapsulations means gather all related infomation. By Creating Bean classes.

Q.     how you r using ovveriding concept in your project?
	  All basectl method 

Q.	***Did you use Dynamic(Runtime) and Static(Fixed) preload And if yes Where?
	Static by using hashmap object on view.				// more should be written on it.
	Dynamic by overriding preload().

Q.	Dynamic And Static Methods? 
	Overriding(Runtime polymorphism) And OverLoading.

Q.	Did you override validate method to put Input validations, if so From where you have overriden it?
					OR
	How you used Input validations in our project04? 
	BY OVERRIDING VALIDATE() in service() of BaseCtl.

Q.  	Do we have overidden validate() on our listCtl? 
	NO

Q.	How we achieved refrential integrity (Concept of FK) in our project?

	  when it is apply ? 
	To perform authentication logic and so on.

Q.     write the code to make frontcontroller?



Q. 	Filter???
	Filter perform pre processing and post processsing on a request and response of a client.

	Filter intercepts incoming HttpRequest and perform pre processing operations before delivery request to the target servlet.
	when response is generated, it performs post processing operations before sending response back to client.

Q.	 Can we use more than a one frontCtl? if so how?
	 Yes, By using FilterChain object.doFilter(request,response)

Q.	 Definition of FrontCtl Design Pattern?
	 Single Handler for every client request.

Q.	how we can apply for frontctl? 
	By implementing Filter

	2.Appender :-	Responsible for		publishing logging information to various preferred destinations.
	3.layouts:- 	Responsible for 	formatting logging information in different styles.
			
				log4j.appender.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{dd MM yy HH:mm:ss} %5p %c{1}:%L - %m%n
			1.>	%d{dd MM yy HH:mm:ss}? Used to output the date of the logging event. The date conversion specifier may be followed by a date format 				
                                specifier enclosed between braces. For example, %d{HH:mm:ss,SSS} or %d{dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss,SSS}.
                                If no date format specifier is given then ISO8601 format is assumed.

			2.>	%p ? Used to output the priority of the logging event.
			3.>	%c{1}? Used to output the category of the logging event. For example, for the category name "a.b.c" the pattern %c{2} will output"b.c".
			4.>	%L? Used to output the line number from where the logging request was issued.
